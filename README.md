First off, I just want to mention its supposed to be "ze spy gaming", but obviously you can't put spaces.
<br>Anyways,
<br><hr><br>This is just a teeny tiny reimagining of the classic chrome extension **Make Money** that I've been working on for a while.
<br><br>After some time though I decided to put it on github.
<br><br>Dw if you're tryna play this at school and your school blocks it,<br>just let me know and I'll reupload this on another account.
<br><br><a href='https://zespygaming.github.io/nothing/'>Playable Link</a>
<br><br>Current version is a <strong>test release</strong>, it may<br>contain bugs, if you find any please message me about them.
